# CPP_Mastermind_Game
A game to figure out a set of computer generated digits.

The program generates 3 random digits anywhere from 0-9. The user does not know what digits have been chosen. The user has 10 tries to figure out what the digits are. After every guess, the program lets the user know if any of the digits exist in the answer and whether a digit is in place or out of place in the guess provided.
